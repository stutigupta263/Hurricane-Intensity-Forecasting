**Hurricane Intensity Forecasting using LSTM and Vulnerability Analysis**

This project integrates machine learning with socio-demographic analysis to forecast hurricane behavior and identify vulnerable regions. The project focuses on Hurricane Ian, which struck the U.S. in September 2022, and aims to improve disaster preparedness through accurate path and intensity predictions combined with targeted vulnerability assessments.

**Objectives**

1. Vulnerability Analysis:

  -Identify counties most affected by Hurricane Ian.
  
  -Use socio-demographic data (e.g., income, vehicle availability, age distribution) to compute aid scores for disaster management.
  
2. Hurricane Path and Intensity Forecasting:

  -Develop an LSTM-based model to predict hurricane path and intensity using sequential data.
  
  -Evaluate the model's performance with different sliding window sizes.

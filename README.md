Hurricane Intensity Forecasting using LSTM and Vulnerability Analysis
This project integrates machine learning with socio-demographic analysis to forecast hurricane behavior and identify vulnerable regions. The project focuses on Hurricane Ian, which struck the U.S. in September 2022, and aims to improve disaster preparedness through accurate path and intensity predictions combined with targeted vulnerability assessments.
